  ISS-001:
    title: Supabase SMTP not sending auth emails
    severity: critical
    status: investigating
    created: 2026-01-16
    epic: EP-009
    description: |
      Email confirmation emails not being sent via Supabase Auth.
      Resend API works directly (curl test successful), but Supabase
      SMTP integration doesn't appear to be calling Resend at all.
    symptoms:
      - No emails in Resend dashboard from Supabase
      - Signup works but no confirmation email
      - Was working yesterday, stopped today
    attempted_fixes:
      - Verified Resend API key works (curl test)
      - Configured SMTP settings (smtp.resend.com:587)
      - Using onboarding@resend.dev as sender
    next_steps:
      - Check Supabase Auth logs for errors
      - Verify SMTP toggle is actually enabled
      - Consider Supabase rate limiting on project level

    title: RLS policy blocks organization INSERT despite correct policy
    severity: high
    status: workaround_applied
    created: 2026-01-16
    epic: EP-001
    description: |
      Organizations table has correct INSERT policy (WITH CHECK true, TO authenticated)
      but inserts from client still fail with RLS violation.
    root_cause: Unknown - policy appears correct
    workaround: |
      Created server action (completeOnboarding) that uses admin client
      with service role key to bypass RLS for organization creation.
    files_affected:
      - app/src/lib/actions/onboarding.ts
      - app/src/app/onboarding/page.tsx
    permanent_fix_needed: true

    title: Auth callback needed for email verification
    severity: high
    status: resolved
    created: 2026-01-16
    resolved: 2026-01-16
    epic: EP-001
    description: |
      Email verification redirected to root URL which didn't handle
      the token_hash parameter for session establishment.
    fix: |
      Created /auth/callback route that handles both token_hash (email)
      and code (OAuth/PKCE) verification flows.
    files_affected:
      - app/src/app/auth/callback/route.ts

    title: User record not created on signup
    severity: high
    status: resolved
    created: 2026-01-16
    resolved: 2026-01-16
    epic: EP-001
    description: |
      New signups created auth.users record but no public.users record,
      causing onboarding update to fail silently.
    fix: |
      Created trigger on auth.users to automatically create public.users
      record on signup with handle_new_user() function.
    sql_applied: |
      CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
        AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
        FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();

    title: Server action sync function in 'use server' file
    severity: medium
    status: resolved
    created: 2026-01-16
    resolved: 2026-01-16
    epic: EP-009
    description: |
      generateDiffFromEntry was a sync function in cut-sheet-history.ts
      which is marked 'use server'. Next.js requires all exports to be async.
    fix: |
      Moved diff generation utilities to separate file
      app/src/lib/utils/cut-sheet-diff.ts
    files_affected:
      - app/src/lib/actions/cut-sheet-history.ts

    severity: low
